# OVERVIEW
***
An application for UHM students to facilitate buying and selling of student-related goods and service. Users can post valid information about their products on the platform, and the products will be displayed by searching their key words (label). It will be similar to the existing website "Craigslist" with added functionality. Our goal is to work closely as a team and develop a website that is both functional and aesthetic.

Features: 
- Ensure only UH students are allowed access
- Log in to view/post items for sale
- Rate sellers after purchase
- "Like" items to view later

# DEVELOPER GUIDE
***
This section provides information to Meteor developers on how to use this code base as a basis for their own development projects and tasks.

### Installation

First, <a href="https://www.meteor.com/install">install Meteor</a>.

Second, go to the <a href="https://github.com/manoalist/manoalist">Manoalist repo</a>, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system. Using GitHub Desktop is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:
```
$ meteor npm install
```

### Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the package.json file:
```
$ meteor npm run start
```

### Viewing the running app
If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can login using the credentials in settings.development.json, or else register a new account.
