### Introduction

The critical infrastructure of the Pacific Islands, including Hawai'i, faces unique vulnerabilities due to its geographical isolation and limited resources. In a region heavily reliant on satellite communications for connectivity, any disruption can have catastrophic consequences for power generation, water management, healthcare, transportation, and defense systems. A successful cyberattack on these networks could leave communities without essential services, compromise national security, and isolate key military assets in a time of crisis. The stakes are high, and the security of these networks is of great importance.

In early 2024, several high-profile VPN vulnerabilities emerged, exposing the fragility of current network security solutions. These vulnerabilities revealed that even the most secure-looking systems can be exploited, leaving sensitive data and operations at risk. The Department of Defense (DoD) and critical infrastructure providers were particularly impacted, as their reliance on VPNs for secure communication became a significant point of concern. This highlighted the urgent need for advanced, resilient, and adaptable network architectures that can withstand sophisticated attacks from nation state and non-nation state actors.

Satellite communications add another layer of complexity to this issue. A typical satellite passes over a ground station for less than six minutes, necessitating a rapid, secure handshake and data transfer before the connection is lost. This limited window, coupled with the high latency and variable connectivity of satellite links, poses significant challenges for maintaining secure and reliable communications. When managing satellite swarms, these challenges multiply as multiple satellites need to communicate with a single ground station, each requiring secure, uninterrupted data transmission. This is not dissimilar to the challenges faced by cellular networks, where thousands of devices must securely connect to a single cell tower, often under conditions of fluctuating connectivity and high demand.

These complexities underscore the need for a dynamic, zero trust network architecture that can adapt to the unique demands of mobile and satellite communications. My proposed research, "Dynamic Zero Trust Network Architectures for Mobile and Satellite Communications Using Quantum-Resistant VPNs," aims to address these challenges. By leveraging the QUIC protocol and integrating quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, this framework will ensure resilient, low-latency connections that can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions. This will not only secure satellite and cellular communications but will also provide a robust solution for critical infrastructure networks in remote and high-risk environments, such as the Pacific Islands.

### Professional Background and Motivation

My professional journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set in secure software development and cybersecurity. As the Lead Developer for HPCMP Authentication Services, I have led the design and integration of authentication solutions for high-performance computing systems, addressing complex security challenges and ensuring compliance with stringent DoD standards. My experience includes developing secure communication systems for satellites, building and securing ground stations, and leading DevSecOps initiatives for multi-million-dollar defense programs. These roles have deepened my understanding of the critical need for advanced, resilient security frameworks that can protect sensitive data and systems from sophisticated cyber threats.

The motivation for my dissertation proposal stems from a desire to address the persistent security gaps in current VPN technologies and their performance limitations in high-latency, mobile, and satellite environments. My experience with suboptimal VPN performance on government-furnished equipment and my background in satellite communication systems have driven me to explore innovative solutions that combine zero trust principles with quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols. The unique challenges of securing critical infrastructure in remote locations, such as the Pacific islands, further highlight the importance of developing robust and adaptable security solutions.

### Research Interests and Proposed Plan

My research will focus on several interconnected areas, each contributing to the development of a novel, dynamic zero trust network architecture:
1. **Design of Quantum-Resistant VPN Architectures:** Develop a VPN framework using the QUIC protocol, designed to handle the high-latency and variable connectivity typical of mobile and satellite communications. This framework will integrate quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms, ensuring security against both classical and quantum threats.
2. **Dynamic Routing and Access Control Policies:** Design adaptive routing and access control policies that dynamically adjust based on real-time network conditions and user roles. This will involve creating algorithms that can optimize network performance and security, even in environments with intermittent connectivity.
3. **Secure Connector and Relay System:** Implement a secure connector and relay system that enforces zero trust principles, allowing for fine-grained access control and secure communication between devices and network resources. This system will only be accessible after establishing a secure VPN connection, providing an additional layer of security.
4. **Security and Performance Evaluation:** Conduct comprehensive security and performance evaluations of the proposed architecture in simulated mobile and satellite communication scenarios. This will include testing the system's resilience to various attack vectors and its performance under different network conditions.

### Research Plan and Collaboration

To support this research, I will conduct an extensive evaluation of existing VPN technologies, identifying their vulnerabilities and limitations, particularly in quantum threat models. I will collaborate with experts in quantum cryptography and network security to develop and refine my proposed solutions. Leveraging the unique research environment at UH Mānoa, I will access resources such as the university's advanced computing facilities and collaborate with faculty specializing in secure software development and network security.

I plan to implement and test the proposed framework in a controlled environment, simulating the high-latency and variable connectivity conditions typical of mobile and satellite networks. This will allow me to identify potential weaknesses and optimize the architecture for real-world deployment. The results of this research will provide valuable insights into the development of secure, adaptable communication frameworks for critical infrastructure, contributing to the academic body of knowledge and offering practical solutions for national defense and critical infrastructure security.

### Impact and Future Goals

The outcomes of this research have the potential to significantly enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructure communications. By developing a robust, quantum-resistant VPN framework, I aim to provide a practical solution for securing sensitive data and systems against emerging cyber threats. This work will lay the groundwork for future advancements in zero trust architectures and quantum-safe communications, positioning me as a leader in the development of secure systems for critical infrastructure.

Ultimately, my goal is to advance both academic and practical knowledge in this field, contributing to the security and stability of critical infrastructure in the Pacific region and beyond. I am committed to using my expertise and experience to develop innovative solutions that protect our nation's most vital systems, ensuring the safety and security of my community and the broader national interest.

### Conclusion

I am excited about the opportunity to pursue this research at UH Mānoa, where I can collaborate with experts and access the resources necessary to tackle these complex challenges. I am confident that my background in secure software development, combined with my passion for protecting critical infrastructure, makes me well-suited to contribute to the university's research community. I look forward to the chance to further my knowledge and make a meaningful impact through my work on dynamic zero trust network architectures.

This statement of purpose outlines my commitment to advancing the field of secure communications and my desire to contribute to the safety and security of our nation's critical infrastructure. I am eager to bring my experience and dedication to the PhD program at UH Mānoa and to develop innovative solutions that address the pressing cybersecurity challenges of our time.
