*This page presents my statement of purpose in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](https://philipmjohnson.org/essays/why-and-how-to-write-a-high-quality-phd-portfolio.html). It summarizes my personal and professional history, adversity, and resiliency.*

### Introduction

I am writing to express my deep interest in pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (UH Mānoa), focusing on the development of a quantum-resistant, dual-mode zero trust framework to secure the Department of Defense and national critical infrastructure. My journey to this point hasn't been a straight line; it's been filled with challenges and hard-won victories. Neither of my parents completed high school, I'm the first in my family to graduate from college, and my path here has been paved by a motivated young Sailor learning life’s lessons the hard way while hitching a ride on a Fast Attack Submarine in the US Navy.

### Childhood

I grew up in Florida, where life hit me mercilessly early on. When I was just five, my younger brother drowned, and my mom attempted suicide while struggling with his loss. My older sister and I lived with my grandparents in Indiana while my mom recovered physically and emotionally. When I went back to Florida, things were tough, but I found something that made sense to me: computers. I was the kid who took apart PCs and put them back together, who was always curious about how things worked. By high school, I was deep into programming and even won a state championship for Technology Problem Solving.

Unfortunately, at eighteen, I suddenly found myself without a home. I lived in a tent for a week before finding a place in a friend's garage. I worked two jobs while finishing high school, determined to make something of myself. That determination led me to the Navy, where I joined the Nuclear Power Training Pipeline. It was tough, and for the first time, I had to learn how to study and struggled to understand new concepts. However, I did it, and it changed my life.

### Life Under the Ocean
In the Navy, I became a Nuclear Trained Electronic Technician and eventually a Chief. I taught digital microprocessor design for three years and led and trained a team of men responsible for safe nuclear reactor operations, maintenance, repair, and certification. The Navy brought me to Honolulu and I knew I had found my forever home. After serving fourteen years in the Navy, I set my sights on family and education. I jumped straight into studying Computer Science, still driven by that same love for technology.

I've gone without life’s most basic needs, performed emergency repairs to nuclear reactor instrumentation and control electronics while submerged in hostile waters, worked on NASA projects, designed tech for satellite missions orbiting the earth, and now I'm leading a team at the Department of Defense to secure the nation's most advanced supercomputers from the most technically competent adversaries in the world. Every step has been about self assessment, tackling each challenge, and continuing to learn something new each day.

### Conclusion

I am ready for the next big step. I want to continue my journey at UH Mānoa in the Computer Science PhD program because I know it's the next step to making a big difference. It's not just about getting a degree; it's about pushing myself further, protecting our nation's critical infrastructure, and showing my kids that no matter where you start, you can achieve great things with hard work and passion.

My wife, Janelle Wells, has supported me throughout the last decade of my journey and I’m forever grateful. Her tireless support and unparalleled patience is the keystone supporting the weights of my educational voyage and I’m happy to have her support moving forward as I complete this next major milestone in our lives. I'm excited about the chance to join UH Mānoa’s PhD program to be a part of an elite team of researchers, to keep growing as a life-long-learner, and to take on whatever challenges come next.
